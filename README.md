# Spotify Synchronizer

Spotify Synchronizer allows you to synchronize your local library with your Spotify library.

It will scan your current local library location and checks if your Spotify library songs are locally available.
As an addition, it will also verify that the metadata of the mp3 files is the same as the data from Spotify, if not, it updates the mp3 file data.
